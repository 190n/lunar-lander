lunar-lander
============

A HTML5 Canvas version of the game(s)
[Lunar Lander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(video_game_series)).

How to play
-----------

Open `index.html`. A fairly recent browser is required as the code uses some
ES2016+ features. If this advances enough for me to consider releasing it
anywhere besides GitHub I will set up a build process for older browsers.

### Controls:

Basically copied from Kerbal Space Program.

| key | action|
|---|------------|
| `A` | rotate left |
| `D` | rotate right|
| `Z` | full throttle |
| `X` | cut throttle |
| `shift` | throttle up |
| `ctrl` | throttle down |
